## Description

In this project, we have built a password generator using Python. The password generator prompts the user to enter the desired length of the password and then generates a random password of that specified length. The generated password will be a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters, making it strong and secure.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   
git clone ( https://github.com/AadishBansal12/Password-Generator.git )

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd Password-Generator

3. Run the Python script:
python Password-Generator.py


4. Follow the instructions provided by the program. Enter the desired password length, and the password generator will generate a random password for you.
